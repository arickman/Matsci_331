#since we are calculating the energy per atom. 
#For N,M,L = 4, E_tot/natoms =  -6.0., as expected.

#2.2 For r_c = 3, M,N,L = 3, E_tot/natoms = -8.129509137272224

#negative contributions from non-nearest neighbor atoms.

#yield [ 1.57772181e-30  1.57772181e-30 -0.00000000e+00], a value very close to zero (numerical precision errors). This is also the case for other i.  
# This is what we expect since we are in a stable atomic configuration (no vacancies yet).  

#3.4 When we increase the lattice constant, the force on the i=8 atom changes
#to [ 6.9388939e-18  6.9388939e-18 -0.0000000e+00] (a ->2a).
#The force is still roughly zero, which makes sense since we are still in a stable atomic configuration. 
#We also notice the energy/atom decreasing in magnitude as we increase a, which makes sense,
#since the atoms aren't as close together anymore and experience less attraction/repulsion from one another. 
#We also eventually go behond the cutoff and contribute zero energy from Lennard Jones.

#7.1
#alpha is the hyper-parameter associated with the gradient descent minimization above. If we make
#alpha too big, we jump over the minimum repeatedly, and we don't see monotonic decrease in the energy. 
#If alpha is too small, it simply takes too long to converge. In part 6 for example, the alpha appropriate for 
#gradient descent for the earlier parts was now too big and missed the minimum, so I decreased it,
#but not too low so as to converge very slowly. 

#7.2
#Now we put in an interstital in the case of the density calculations above, and we immediately find that
# alpha is now too small, and takes many more steps to converge than without the interstitial. Before it took 
#roughly 27 steps to converge (talking about the energy minimization of course), and now we see orders of magnitude more steps.
# We need to increase alpha to get this algorithm to converge to the same tolerance as before. So clearly the initial atomic configuration does affect
#the optimal alpha value, and thus when optimizing this hyperparameter, we can look to the initial atomic configuration when possible.
