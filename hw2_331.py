#2.1 For r_c = 1.3, M,N,L = 3, E_tot/natoms = -6.0. 
#This number should stay roughly the same in magnitude as we change N,L,M,
#since we are calculating the energy per atom. 
#For N,M,L = 4, E_tot/natoms =  -6.0., as expected.

#2.2 For r_c = 3, M,N,L = 3, E_tot/natoms = -8.129509137272224 
#This is slightly more negative because as r_c increases, we are adding more
#negative contributions from non-nearest neighbor atoms. 

#3.3 Printing out the force for a random atom, (i=8) in this case, we 
#yield [1.38777878e-17 4.16333634e-17 2.49800181e-16], very close to zero (numerical precision errors). 
# This is what we expect since we are in a stable atomic configuration (no vacancies yet).  

#3.4 When we double the lattice constant, the force on the i=8 atom changes
#to [ 6.9388939e-18  6.9388939e-18 -0.0000000e+00].
#The force is still roughly zero, which makes sense since we are still in a stable atomic configuration. 
#We also notice the energy/atom decreasing in magnitude to -0.18603515625000003, which makes sense,
#since the atoms aren't as close together anymore and experience less attraction/repulsion from one another.

#In class, we saw the ratio of cohesive energy to vacancy energy for this
#pair potential being 1. E_coh = - (E_tot/natoms) = 6.0, therefore this

# relaxation/movement of particles towards the vacancy.

# to [-2.91433544e-16  3.11558880e-02  3.11558880e-02] (r_c = 3). This shows a force of essentially 0

#L = N = M = (threshold = 0.5). The energy decreased even further to .

#5.5
#Compute the ratio of the converged vacancy energy to the cohesive energy and com- pare to the values of around 0.3 that are observed for metals.
# E_coh = 6.0, and from the previous calculation with relaxation we have the converged vacancy energy as . Thus, the ratio is .

#Do you think that relaxation of the atoms can account for the discrepancy in this ratio between pair potentials and metals discussed in class?
